# Getting-Started

This repository contains instructions to get started with ANSYS Machine Learning. It is intended to help you with setting up and guide you through the workflow.
Typically, we use Docker containers or virtual environments to transport our code accross platforms from our local machines to our more computationally powerful remote machines.

## Configuring your laptop
To get started follow the steps below:
1. [Install Python](InstallingPython.md)
  1. Install Git (optional)
  1. Install your IDE of choice (I like Pycharm).
1. [Install Docker](InstallingDocker.md)
